Shilling contests. Giveaways (e.g., "Like, follow, and share" contests with rewards like $10 or $20 worth of tokens). Organize community-driven raids to amplify reach and visibility.

Visibility on Key Platforms
Secure listing on DEXScreener, leveraging its popularity for newly listed projects. Invest in paid advertisements and boosts on DEXScreener to enhance visibility.

Influencer Collaboration
Partner with prominent Solana influencers on X to promote Trax AI. Encourage influencers to pin Trax AI-related content on their pages to increase awareness and credibility.

Promotional Campaigns
Collaborate with high-traffic channels and groups to spotlight the project through sponsored calls.

Community Voting Initiatives
Actively participate in voting on multiple listing sites to boost project visibility. Explore methods to maximize voting efficiency, such as leveraging VPNs or strategic re-login tactics where applicable.

Clean and Transparent Community Management
Avoid excessive spamming and irrelevant content such as random stickers, GIFs, and memes. Ensure timely and thoughtful responses to community queries. Limit developer interactions to essential announcements and instructions, maintaining a professional and focused tone.

Team Cohesion and Governance
Ensure the development team collaborates effectively, with the lead developer providing clear instructions and support to the team. Encourage transparency and responsiveness within the team.

Token Distribution and Transparency
Limit the holdings of the development team and top holders to less than 20% of the total supply to avoid perceptions of centralization or rug-pull risks. Keep token use internal initially, focusing on ecosystem growth, with plans to expand utility as the project matures.

Team Rewards and Incentives
Compensate team members in SOL weekly and allocate token supplies as recognition for their contributions to the community’s growth and success.

Blockchain Integration
While Trax AI operates primarily on X, its architecture supports future blockchain integration to further enhance functionality.
